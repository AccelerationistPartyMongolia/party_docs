The Accelerationist Party believes in this fundamental concept: Mongolia is a nation of liberal democratic institutions and a society of freedom, liberty and independence long seen through its nomadic tradition and history of drive towards self-determination. In a stark contrast to the ocean of dictatorships of Russia, China and Central Asia that exists in its periphery, Mongolia alone remains as an island of liberty, not unlike an island of pirates in the midst of a treacherous ocean. This liberty is to be protected at all costs, and no concessions to security or authority that infringes on this liberty will ever be tolerated.

The Accelerationist Party follows left accelerationism as its ideology of inspiration as posited by academics Nick Srnicek, Alex Williams and Mark Fisher; and thus does not identify with far-right extremism and actively condemns the far-right.
