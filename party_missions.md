## Our missions include:
1. Holding the line of freedom and democracy to resist the allure of autocracies. For no dictatorship lasted a hundred years, while centuries-old democracies are aplenty. As Mongolians, we choose the latter.
2. Expanding Mongolia’s Overton window to include ideas already in circulation in developed countries, but has found little mention or audience within Mongolia to expand the political imagination of the people.
3. Strengthening the civil democratic values and political consciousness of the Mongolian nation to create a free and harmonious Gesellschaft.
4. Continuing to show the vulnerability of the modern Mongolian kakistocracy and those who perpetuate its existence; through campaigning, strikes, civil disobedience and protests to show that not only is change still possible and within reach, but those who prevent it are vulnerable and fallible.
5. Enriching the country’s national-urban aesthetic with diverse and bustling pursuits of art whose aesthetic particularities, urban-industrial culture and expression of modernity could only have manifested here, and nowhere else.
6. Establishing and promoting a nation of artists, tinkers, creatives and artisans. Artisticity, craftsmanship and creativity as the DNA of this new society.
7. Setting the foundation for the nation’s quaternary economic sector and bringing forth its transition into a knowledge economy.
8. Promoting diversity and inclusiveness in all areas of society, including race, gender, religion, and sexual orientation to further insulate society from counterintuitive reactionary norms.
9. Establishment of a digital direct democracy, in which citizens have a greater influence in policy decisions with lesser need of elected representatives.
10. Putting an end to the illusion of respectability politics that disenfranchise voices of the populace while platforming established elites.
