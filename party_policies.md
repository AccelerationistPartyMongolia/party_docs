## SHORT-TERM — Policies that can be passed instantly by a parliament majority with little to no budget fluctuations. Expected to be accomplished within 1–2 years.

## MEDIUM-TERM — Policies that may require a greater degree of investment in time, money and planning to implement. Expected to take about 3–8 years.

1. Implementing tax reform in urban areas, incorporating principles of the Georgist tax system, with a focus on land value tax and reduced taxes on other items.

13. Encouraging the development and use of renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, and hydro power, along with sustainable living methods such as vertical farming and waste reduction.

16. Dirigisme policy for strategically significant value-adding industries or inelastic markets whose main purpose is enabling other markets to flourish.

18. Passing the Marcora Law that allows employees to cash-in all of their accumulated unemployment benefits to capitalize a buyout for their failing businesses and establish a worker cooperative.

## LONG-TERM — Policies that will require amending the constitution, or will take an extremely long time to be fully realized. Expected to take longer than 8 years.

1. Reforming the national academic sector to make academic careers more viable, while proliferating cross-university expertise pollination and establishing a collaboration sector with the state that allows academia to provide cross-discipline technocratic counsel to the state.
2. Amending the constitution to do away with constitutional roadblocks towards marriage equality and remove barriers to adoption for same-sex couples.
3. Investigating the possibility of and acting on a project to attract South Korean and Japanese manufacturing firms onto a Western Mongolian special economic zone where Central Asian migrants with work visas are to be employed for blue-collar work with competitive remittable wages while Mongolians are stipulated to be hired for white-collar work such as engineering, administration and middle management to learn from South Korean and Japanese business practices and industrial know-how up close.
4. Establishment of a universal basic income to either keep the populace producing or spending once the nation has achieved sufficient economic capabilities to support it.
5. State support for the proliferation of a Tönniesian Gesellschaft society over the currently dominant Tönniesian Gemeinschaft culture in order to fight nepotism and boost individualism.
6. Within the scope of the UBI program and the Marcora Law, establish a stock market exclusively for cooperatives to allow for a pluralized form of capital access. We recognize that current economic systems often perpetuate inequalities, so we propose that individuals should be able to buy shares in cooperatives through monthly stock purchase plans exclusively within the UBI program. By limiting stock purchases to the amount given monthly through UBI, we can protect the democratic procedure of worker cooperatives from wealthy stockholders and allow the possibility for you to directly assist your favorite small businesses.

## MEME-TERM — Policies that are memes. Maybe we won’t pass it. OR MAYBE WE WILL.

1. Political asylum for all hackers across the world.

6. Every Mongolian Guinness World Record holder to be exempt from all taxes. (In the case of Tommy Tallarico ever attaining Mongolian citizenship, he will be specifically excluded from this tax exemption.)
7. Supporting the promotion and marketing of anime and K-pop content through public relations and marketing campaigns, as well as by participating in international festivals and events.
8. Implementing the Emiin Gurvan Naadam. It is still wrestling, archery and horse-racing, but finally women can participate in it as well.
9. Encouraging the development and use of supernatural abilities and new age religions through religious practices and training, and protecting the rights of individuals with supernatural abilities, such as by prohibiting discrimination and ensuring equal treatment under the law while also regulating the use of supernatural abilities to prevent harm to others and to promote responsible and ethical use.
10. Cultivating alliances and partners: To further its goals, the regime may seek to form alliances or partnerships with other nations, religious orders (like the Vatican and the Taliban), or other powerful actors (like aliens and Gods).

## NON-POLICY — Stuff that aren’t exactly policies, but modus operandi. Half-meme, half-serious.

1. Supporting the membership of a democratic and reformed Russian state in the European Union once Vladimir Putin is inevitably thrown out of office, so Mongolia can finally border the European Union.
2. Recognizing India as a global Great Power and Asia’s counterpoint to China, participating in India’s “Necklace of Diamonds” strategy and adjusting our diplomacy in accordance to it.
3. Commitment to party finance exclusively through crowdfunding, while either rejecting or disclosing donations from large corporations or international political interest groups.
